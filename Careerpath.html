                                        The type of training a laboratory analyst receives depends on his or her area
                                        of ​​expertise. <br>
                                        Educational institutions often instruct inspection technicians about specific
                                        inspection procedures during on-the-job training. <br>
                                        Training may include learning specific methods, generating reports, and properly
                                        disposing of waste. <br>
                                        Lab Techs can also receive off-the-job training in the form of science seminars
                                        and conferences. <br>
                                        There are various conferences where laboratory technicians can attend depending
                                        on their area of ​​expertise and area of ​​expertise. <br>
                                        During these meetings, they can learn more about their disciplines to keep up
                                        with industry trends and scientific discoveries.<br></p>

                                    <p>Problem-solving:<br>
                                        The laboratory technician needs to be able to review various data and select the
                                        appropriate solution. <br>
                                        The problem-solving process must be systematic and thorough in order to achieve
                                        satisfactory results. <br></p>
                                    <p>
                                        Analysis: <br>
                                        Laboratory technicians often need to collect and analyze large amounts of data
                                        and information. <br>
                                        They should be able to find the connection of results using analytical
                                        techniques. <br></p>

                                        Communication: <br>
                                        Oral communication skills are essential because lab technicians often work
                                        closely with colleagues. <br>
                                        They should be able to work together to complete tasks and experiments. <br>
                                        Additionally, lab techs should have excellent written communication skills as
                                        they need to write <br>
                                        reports on their findings so that others can understand the information.</p><br>

                                    <p><i>Education</i><br>
                                        To be a food scientist, you would require at least a bachelor's degree, but most
                                        employers prefer either a master's or doctoral degree. <br>
                                        You should also complete science and engineering courses at both levels.
                                        Coursework includes food processing, food laws and regulations, <br>
                                        and food analysis. Emerging food scientists need training in nutrition, food
                                        safety, processing, and computer science.</p><br>

                                        Although certifications won't always be a requirement to work as a food
                                        scientist, they can certainly help. <br>
                                        Certifications for food scientists can be obtained through the American Society
                                        of Agronomy and the American <br>
                                        Registry of Professional Animal Scientists. Most certifications require you to
                                        work in the field for a <br>
                                        period of time before taking the exam.</p><br>

                                    <p>Technology:<br>
                                        Most food scientists use technology and computer programs to experiment and
                                        analyze data. <br>
                                        Working with computer programs and being able to code can be useful in this
                                        position. </p>

                                    <p>Communication:<br>
                                        Requires good written and verbal communication skills. <br>
                                        Scientists contact team members to discuss projects and report results. </p>

                                    <p>Research:<br>
                                        Most of the food scientist's position is research. Sufficient <br>
                                        research knowledge of food production and quality is important in this role.</p>
