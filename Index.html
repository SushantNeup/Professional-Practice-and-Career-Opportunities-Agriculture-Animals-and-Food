                                        Computers in the
                                        Food Industry<br />

                                    <p><br />
                                        The food industry is responsible for supplying food to the United States and
                                        many of its trading
                                        partners. <br>
                                        To meet future demand, industry leaders have invested in robotics and automation
                                        technology to
                                        improve efficiency and scalability. <br>
                                        The most important areas of development include automatic irrigation,
                                        fertilization, harvesting
                                        and breeding systems. <br>
                                        Improvements in these processes are aimed at reducing production costs and
                                        saving water, fuel
                                        and fertilizer. <br>
                                    <p></p>

                                        Many of these technologies are not only efficient, but also replace the<br>
                                        associated workforce. Partly spurred by the lack of human resources to harvest
                                        fruit, some large<br>
                                        trading companies have deployed harvesting robots that can cover the acreage of
                                        several workers. <br>
                                        Given the impact of COVID-19 on the US border and worker flow, many
                                        companies<br>
                                        have a strong incentive to continue investing in these technologies to further
                                        reduce their workforce needs. <br>
                                        With the advent of self-driving tractors and sprayers, the need for
                                        personnel is further reduced. <br>
                                        Further in the supply chain, automation of distribution warehouses and grocery
                                        stores is accelerating.<br>
                                        Many warehouses have replaced traditional forklifts with automatic guided <br>
                                        vehicles (AGVs).This allows you to perform many tasks that were previously
                                        performed by multiple workers. <br>
                                        Unloading and loading trucks, moving large luggage in the warehouse, etc. <br>
                                        In addition, it can be operated for a long time even under harsh conditions such
                                        as a freezer or a refrigerated environment. <br>

                                        According to McKinsey & Company's analysis, nearly three-quarters of hospitality
                                        and
                                        accommodation
                                        tasks can be automated. These include various tasks. <br>
                                        Industrial robots work with AI, thermal scanners, and lasers to chop vegetables,
                                        grill
                                        hamburgers
                                        and other foods, and perform similar tasks. <br>
                                        AI is currently being used to improve cooking processes, such as recipe
                                        optimization and
                                        ingredient
                                        selection. <br>
                                        Similarly, the front end of the restaurant is undergoing major technology-driven
                                        changes. <br>
                                        In particular, we have seen a shift to more automated services that allow
                                        cashiers to place
                                        orders,
                                        make payments and assign tables using voice or facial recognition.<br>

                                        Computers in the
                                        Agriculture Industry<br />
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Today, agriculture is not limited to the production of crops, livestock and
                                        related activities.
                                        <br>
                                        The challenges posed by ecological factors affecting the environment should be a
                                        primary
                                        consideration for any type of agricultural activity. <br>
                                        Farmers need to anticipate the environmental impact of climate change and this
                                        is where modern
                                        technology comes to the rescue. <br>
                                        In a nutshell, the uses of computers in agriculture include:<br>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>There is software to help forecast weather conditions and estimate agricultural
                                        production. <br>
                                        Computers are used to keep records of information related to costs associated
                                        with production,
                                        transportation, agricultural processes and to estimate and calculate profits
                                        and/or losses. <br>
                                        The Internet facilitates communication between farmers and between farmers and
                                        agricultural
                                        professionals. <br>
                                        This leads to the exchange of knowledge and guidance for farmers to improve
                                        their production and
                                        realize profits. <br>
                                        Through the use of software technology, farming activities have evolved into
                                        those that require
                                        less
                                        effort and lead to larger yields. <br>
                                        Mechanization has reduced human/animal effort and increased production speed and
                                        quality.<br>
                                    </p>

                                    <p> Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to develop rating systems for
                                        soil assessment and
                                        provide site assessments to help with what is now known as precision farming.
                                        <br>
                                        These high-tech interactive systems provide information based on a variety of
                                        factors such as
                                        soil
                                        conditions, drainage conditions and slopes, soil pH and nutrient status, and
                                        more. <br>
                                        Prior to the use of these systems, farmers were often unaware of soil production
                                        and
                                        unpredictable
                                        weather conditions affecting crop quality and profitability. <br>
                                        Precision farming gives farmers control by predicting key information including
                                        fertilization
                                        and
                                        drainage problems, insects and weeds. <br>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Automated farm equipment, needless to say, ranks against human-driven equipment
                                        in terms of
                                        consistency and reliability. <br>
                                        Engine and machine functions such as transmission and hydraulic power are
                                        controlled using
